# CNNprocessingspeed
Aims at increasing CNN speed using different strucutures like,
1)Bottleneck
2)Wider Convolutions
3)Mixing both bottleneck and wider convolutions.

In this project, bottleneck and wider convolutions, both come up neck to neck with bottleneck slightly outperforming the wider convolutions.
This .py file includes structures of a basic cnn, bottleneck , widerconvolutions and bottlewide(mixture of bottleneck and wider convolutions) and allows the user to select the required structure of their choice.
